# focuslane

focuslane is a Firefox extension that makes YouTube calmer and more intentional. It blocks common distraction surfaces, supports focus modes, filters videos with natural-language AI rules, skips sponsor segments, restores estimated dislike counts, and tracks focus-related stats.

The extension is built as a Firefox Manifest V2 add-on with a background script, a YouTube content script, and a popup UI.

## Install

Install focuslane from Firefox Add-ons:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/focuslane/

## Features

### Focus Modes

focuslane includes preset modes for different levels of YouTube cleanup:

- **Minimal**: blocks Shorts and hides comments while keeping most of YouTube intact.
- **Study**: removes more recommendation surfaces such as watch sidebars, end screens, info cards, live chat, notifications, community posts, and playables.
- **Strict**: hides the home feed and major discovery surfaces for a more locked-down YouTube experience.
- **Custom**: lets you manually adjust individual controls.

### Distraction Controls

The popup exposes toggles for:

- Blocking Shorts links, shelves, cards, sidebar entries, and direct Shorts pages.
- Hiding comments.
- Hiding the YouTube home feed.
- Hiding the watch page sidebar.
- Hiding end screens and info cards.
- Hiding Explore, Trending, Gaming, Live, Playables, community posts, live chat, and notifications.
- Forcing autoplay off.

### AI Video Filtering

focuslane can classify YouTube video title, channel, and visible description metadata against a natural-language rule, such as:

> Only show programming tutorials and tech reviews. Hide gaming, vlogs, and politics.

When a usable rule is configured, matching video metadata is sent to the configured focuslane classification backend. Results are cached locally to reduce repeated classification requests.

AI filtering includes:

- Natural-language rule composer.
- Rule validation.
- Reusable rule history.
- Local cache clearing.
- Stats for videos hidden by the AI filter.
- A list of AI-filtered videos grouped by Today, Week, and All Time.

### Learning Stack

The Learning Stack helps keep YouTube sessions focused by letting you build a queue of learning videos. It can gate navigation away from the selected queue and provide controls to resume, complete, remove, or find more videos for the session.

### Schedule, Pomodoro, and Temporary Unlock

focuslane can relax or apply settings depending on context:

- **Focus hours**: apply the selected mode only during configured days and times.
- **Pomodoro**: run focus and break phases with configurable durations.
- **Temporary unlock**: type `FOCUS` to unlock relaxed browsing for 5, 15, or 30 minutes.

### SponsorBlock

When enabled, focuslane uses the public SponsorBlock API for the current video. It can:

- Automatically skip sponsor segments.
- Ask before skipping.
- Render sponsor markers.
- Track skipped sponsor segments and skipped seconds.

### Return YouTube Dislike

When enabled, focuslane requests estimated dislike counts from Return YouTube Dislike for the current YouTube video and displays the count beside the dislike button. Local like/dislike interactions adjust the displayed count immediately.

### Stats

The popup includes a Stats tab with period filters for:

- Shorts blocked.
- Recommendations hidden.
- AI-filtered videos.
- Sponsor segments skipped.
- Focus minutes.
- Temporary unlocks.
- Estimated minutes saved.

## Privacy and External Services

focuslane stores settings and runtime state in Firefox extension storage.

The extension declares no data collection in `manifest.json`:

```json
"data_collection_permissions": {
  "required": ["none"],
  "optional": []
}
```

Some optional features call external services when enabled or used:

- **AI filtering** sends video title, channel, visible description metadata, and the configured filter rule to `https://focuslane-api.kytehe.workers.dev/api/classify`.
- **SponsorBlock** sends the current YouTube video ID to `https://sponsor.ajay.app`.
- **Return YouTube Dislike** sends the current YouTube video ID to `https://returnyoutubedislikeapi.com`.

These services are only needed for their corresponding features. Cache entries are stored locally and can be cleared from the popup.

## Permissions

The extension requests:

- `storage`: save settings, caches, stats, and runtime state.
- `tabs`: close or redirect tabs when focus controls require it.
- `webRequest` and `webRequestBlocking`: redirect direct YouTube Shorts requests when Shorts blocking is active.
- `*://*.youtube.com/*`: apply focus controls on YouTube.
- `https://*.workers.dev/*`: call the AI classification backend.
- `https://sponsor.ajay.app/*`: fetch SponsorBlock segments.
- `https://returnyoutubedislikeapi.com/*`: fetch estimated dislike counts.

```

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm
- Firefox

The project uses [`web-ext`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) for linting, packaging, and AMO submission.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Development

For manual testing in Firefox, load the extension temporarily:

1. Open Firefox.
2. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**.
4. Select `manifest.json` from this repository.
5. Open YouTube and use the focuslane toolbar popup to configure settings.

You can also use `web-ext` directly if you prefer a managed development run:

```bash
npx web-ext run --source-dir .
```

## Validation

Run extension linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This validates the extension with `web-ext lint`.

## Build

Create an unsigned extension package in `artifacts/`:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build script ignores development-only files such as `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.github/**`, and `artifacts/**`.

## Publish to AMO

Publishing is handled by:

```bash
npm run publish:amo
```

This command signs and submits the listed extension to Mozilla Add-ons using `web-ext sign`.

Required environment variables:

- `WEB_EXT_API_KEY`
- `WEB_EXT_API_SECRET`

The GitHub workflow maps these from repository secrets:

- `AMO_JWT_ISSUER`
- `AMO_JWT_SECRET`

## Release Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow runs on:

- Pushes to `main`.
- Published GitHub releases.

On every run, it:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`.
3. Runs `npm run lint`.
4. Builds an unsigned extension package.
5. Uploads the package as a workflow artifact.

For published releases, it also:

1. Verifies the release tag matches `manifest.json` version.
2. Verifies AMO credentials are configured.
3. Submits the extension to AMO.

Release tags must use the format `vX.Y.Z` and match the manifest version. For example, `v2.0.1` must match:

```json
"version": "2.0.1"
```

## Configuration Notes

The canonical extension version is stored in `manifest.json`.

Some settings are intentionally disabled in the current popup/runtime path:

- `endGuard`
- `endGuardCloseTab`
- `intentGate`

They are forced off by the frontend settings sanitizer and are not shown as active popup controls.

## Troubleshooting

### `web-ext update check failed`

If `npm run lint` succeeds but prints an update-check warning about `/Users/<user>/.config`, the lint result is still valid. The warning is from `web-ext` trying to access its local update config store.

### AI filtering is not hiding videos

Check that:

- The AI filter rule has at least one word.
- You clicked **Apply filter** or waited for auto-save.
- YouTube has loaded video cards on the current page.
- The AI backend is reachable.

You can also clear caches from the popup and try again.

### Sponsor skipping is not working

Check that:

- SponsorBlock is enabled in Settings.
- The current video has submitted sponsor segments.
- The skip mode is set to either automatic skip or prompt.

### Dislike count is unavailable

Return YouTube Dislike may not have data for every video. The extension will show an unavailable state when the service does not return a usable count.
